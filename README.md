**SRE Introduction**
- What is the role of an SRE?

    - The role of SRE is            predominantly to ensure reliability of online services.

    - This done using automation of scaling and load-balancing.

**Cloud Computing**
- What is cloud computing and the benefits of using it?

    - The 4 key advantages of cloud-computing are:

        1 Ease of use
        2 Flexibility
        3 Robustness
        4 Cost Savings

        Other advantages include:

        - Increased security
        - Better insight
        - Increased collaboration
        - Quality control


**What is Amazon Web Service? (AWS)**
- What is AWS and the benefits of using it?

    AWS is an on-demand cloud computig platform available to individuals, companies and governments on a pay-as-you-go basis.

    - AWS services offer tools for compute power, database storage and content delivery services.

        - Easy to use
        - Flexible
        - Cost-Effective
        - Reliable
        - Scalable and high-performance
        - Secure


**What is SDLC and the stages of SDLC?**
- What is SDLC and the stages of it?

    SDLC refers to a methodology with clearly defined process for creating high-quality software. Includes the following phases:

    - Requirements analysis
    - Planning
    - Software design (Architectural design)
    - Software development
    - Testing
    - Deployment

**What is the risk level at each stage of SDLC?**
- LOW
- MEDIUM
- HIGH
